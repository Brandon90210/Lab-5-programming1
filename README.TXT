24. A HashMap is a parameterized class. This class uses parameters such as K and V in order to identify the type of mapped values and
the type of keys maintained by this map. To use it you must set the values of K and V.

26. use the entry set method.

28. it will replace the old key

29. Both keys are stored

30. String lookupNumber(String name) then enter the name

31. it returns null

32. create a method that prints all keys that are currently stored in that map.

34. similarities: They are both iterable, They are both unsyncronized (no particular order), They both grow as elements are added.

Differences: HashSets do not allow duplicates while the ArrayList does, The HashSet does not guarantee the order
of elements, HashSet allows constant time while the Array list allows amortized constant time.

35. an ArrayList returns it at random

36. no it still compiles

40. I would create another hashmap to identify the synonyms

41. I would find the matching words and add a better answer

42. I would enter words like "why", "how" and "who"
