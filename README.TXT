24. A HashMap is a parameterized class. This class uses parameters such as K and V in order to identify the type of mapped values and
the type of keys maintained by this map. To use it you must set the values of K and V.

25. compute, computeIfAbsent, computeIfPresent, put, putAll, putIfAbsent, replaceAll. Yes i think the same type can be used for both
parameters.

26. use the entry set method.

34. similarities: They are both iterable, They are both unsyncronized (no particular order), They both grow as elements are added.

Differences: HashSets do not allow duplicates while the ArrayList does, The HashSet does not guarantee the order
of elements, HashSet allows constant time while the Array list allows amortized constant time.
